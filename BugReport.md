# Bug Report

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Missing Error Handling in Form Submission

**File**: `src/components/ui/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

Form submissions showed a success message even when the edge function returned an error. This caused:

-   User confusion due to misleading success messages
-   Incomplete or failed data operations going unnoticed
-   Reduced trust in system feedback

#### Root Cause

The form did not handle error responses from the edge function. Success state was set by default after submission, regardless of response status.

#### Fix

Added error handling logic to evaluate the edge function response. Now, only responses with a success status trigger the success message. If an error occurs, an alert is shown:

```tsx
if (!isSuccess) {
	alert("Failed to send confirmation email");
	setSubmitted(false);
	return;
} else {
	const lead = {
		name: formData.name,
		email: formData.email,
		industry: formData.industry,
		submitted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
	};
	setLeads([...leads, lead]);
	setSubmitted(true);
	setFormData({ name: "", email: "", industry: "" });
}
```

#### Impact

-   ✅ Accurate success/failure feedback on form submission
-   ✅ Improved user experience and clarity
-   ✅ Reduced risk of data inconsistency

### 2. Duplicate Email Trigger from Edge Function

**File**: `src/components/ui/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Critical
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem

The edge function was triggering the email sending logic twice, resulting in:

-   Duplicate emails being sent to users
-   Increased API usage and OpenAI token consumption
-   Higher operational costs

#### Root Cause

The email trigger function was unintentionally called twice within the same submission flow.

#### Fix

Removed the redundant email function call:

```ts
// Removed second call to await supabase.functions.invoke("send-confirmation")
```

#### Impact

-   ✅ Eliminated duplicate emails
-   ✅ Lowered email processing overhead
-   ✅ Reduced operational and OpenAI API costs
